    info: "Coffee grown worldwide can trace its heritage back centuries to the ancient coffee forests on the Ethiopian plateau. There, legend says the goat herder Kaldi first discovered the potential of these beloved beans.The story goes that that Kaldi discovered coffee after he noticed that after eating the berries from a certain tree, his goats became so energetic that they did not want to sleep at night. Kaldi reported his findings to the abbot of the local monastery, who made a drink with the berries and found that it kept him alert through the long hours of evening prayer. The abbot shared his discovery with the other monks at the monastery, and knowledge of the energizing berries began to spread.",

    info: "The history of coffee in Asia, much like the history of coffee in Europe and the Americas, began with a crime. In the early 1600s, a man by the name of Baba Budan who was on a pilgrimage to Mecca stopped for a visit to the Yemeni port city of Mocha, the legendary coffee hub that enabled the delicious drink to reach all across Arabia. Hoping to bring the delicious drink with him, Baba Budan smuggled six coffee beans by taping them on to his stomach. After a long journey back to India, Baba Budan planted the coffee beans in the quaint hill town of Chikamagalur, Karnataka. In fact, coffee was so popular that it was being cultivated even before tea. The coffee plant had already established itself as a commercial crop in India by the 19th century and was being exported to Europe. The dense jungles of the West Ghat mountains enabled the growth of arabica and robusta coffee under the shade, which helped contribute to the coffee plant’s unique flavor.",

    info: "A coffee tree presented to Louis XIV by the Dutch in 1715 and nurtured in Paris's Royal Botanical Garden would make an indelible mark on coffee's history with the help of a resolute French naval officer. On leave from Martinique in 1720, Gabriel Mathieu de Clieu was convinced that Martinique could become as successful a coffee producer as Java. When his request for a coffee plant grown from the king's noble tree was summarily denied, de Clieu staged a late night raid on the Royal Garden to secure one of the plants himself. Although de Clieu's daring effort was successful, it actually proved less harrowing than his perilous transatlantic return to Martinique, as he was compelled to share his meager water rations with the fledgling tree. But within 50 years of the plant's arrival on Martinique, de Clieu's heroics literally bore fruit. The confiscated plant yielded over 18,000 coffee trees. Much of the world's coffee, including the majority of the coffee destined for cultivation in the Americas, is descended from that single tree.",
